        <h3>spend two minutes with the the experience and list all of your actions in granular detail.</h3>
        <p> interact with https://tdingsun.github.io/justine/
            I put my cursor on the up-left, there have the title of this sites and the designer name on it. It looks like it have responsive design because there is an underline when my cursor stop on it. However, it don’t give me any respond when I click the words. Then I tapped to the rectangle on the middle of the site it give me respond. A few words shows in the rectangle with some piano-like rhythm going. It seems like the words is bouncing with the music.  At the end I tapped the up-right it just an easy option which allows me to mute the site.

        <h3>What was the first thing you paid attention to when interacting with the experience?</h3>
        <p>tDefinitely the yellow-green background and few words on the green bubble. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
        <h3>What did you spend the most time engaging with?</h3>
        <p>Tapping the different cubes to create a different rhythm and tried to make the rhythm harmony.</p>

        <h3>What is your impression of the intended primary goal of the interactive experience?</h3>
        <p>I just feel like designer make this site as a study material or he/she just try to show off..  The goal of this site it’s more lie a playable and clean site.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="box">
        <h3>How does the experience communicate it's primary goal?</h3>
        <p>I would say he/she is a really good ux/ui engineering designer and this site really catch my eyes. The clickable icons and the well-designed style just make me want to tapped into his/her’s other work. It can be a great portfolio site.</p>    
    </div>
    <div class="box">
        <h3>What is your impression of how the experience should be interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different times)</h3>
        <p>Since it is a portfolio of the designer, I think it is a site that can interacted with a long time. People like the manager who want to hire engineering worker might spent more time than the regular visitors(this situation is also work on students) And seems like the footer of this site can view more of his/her work. And how many times should people tapped in I think it’s a great study martial of a designer’s portfolio. I might tapped into this site few more times to get inspiration.</p>

    <div class="box">
        <h3>What is your impression of how the interactive experience communicates how it should be interacted with over time?</h3>
        <p>I feels like as a designer, it is my job to communicate with the visitors by interactive design. People tapped into my site and I don’t want them to close my site quickly. I want them to have some great time while interact with my site and leave some good impression so that they might want to tapped into my other’s work.</p>

        <h3>What other media forms (digital or otherwise) does the experience reference?</h3>
        <p>he experience primarily relies on the visual and auditory senses, as it features a surrealistic and abstract visual landscape with accompanying ambient music and sound effects.</p>        
    </div>
    <div class="box">
        <h3>What does this reference or references suggest to you about how you should act when engaging with it?</h3>
        <p>on my analysis of the website, the abstract nature of the visuals and ambient music suggests that the experience is intended to be open to interpretation and subjective experience.</p>

        <h3>What is the most frustrating element of the interaction to you and what makes it frustrating?</h3>
        <p>It could be the lack of insturction, the website didn't have enough insturction so the user might just get lost in it. Another thing could be improve is the site might crush with a low powerful device.</p>
