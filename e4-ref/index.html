    <!-- I made a mute botton for the video because I think The addition of the mute/unmute toggle button enhances the overall usability of the media player by giving users control over the audio. 
      This feature allows users to quickly mute or unmute the video without having to adjust the volume manually. It provides a convenient and accessible way to manage the audio experience, ensuring a more immersive and enjoyable viewing experience.-->   
    <!--I've also adjusted the dimensions and positioning of various elements. Which I think that's looks much comfortable.-->
    <!--By adding the background image to the muteButton, you are visually associating an icon (in this case, the mute.svg image) with the mute functionality.
       This helps users quickly understand the purpose and action associated with the button.
When the video is unmuted, the button displays the mute.svg image, indicating that clicking the button will mute the video.
 On the other hand, when the video is already muted, the button toggles to display the unmute.svg image, providing a visual cue that clicking the button will unmute the video.-->


 <!--By using different images for different states of the button, I create a visual affordance that guides users to interact with the button based on its current state. 
  This improves the overall usability and user-friendliness of my media player interface.-->
